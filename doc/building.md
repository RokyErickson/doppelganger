# Building

Doppelganger can be built locally for testing and development. Doppelganger
To see information about the build script, run:
    
	go run scripts/build.go --help

All artifacts from the build are placed in a `build` directory at the root of
the Doppelganger source tree.

    go run scripts/build.go
    build/doppelganger --help

Doppelganger uses Protocol Buffers extensively, and as such needs to generate Go code
from `.proto` files. 
If a `.proto` file is modified, code can be regenerated by running

    go generate ./pkg/...

in the root of the Doppelganger source tree.
